## 📊 Dataset Information

### Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in pattern recognition literature. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:

- **Setosa** (50 samples)
- **Versicolor** (50 samples)
- **Virginica** (50 samples)

### Features

Each sample has four features:

1. **Sepal Length** (cm) - `sepal.length`
2. **Sepal Width** (cm) - `sepal.width`
3. **Petal Length** (cm) - `petal.length`
4. **Petal Width** (cm) - `petal.width`

### Target Variable

- **Variety** - The species of iris (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

### Dataset License

The Iris dataset is in the public domain and is freely available for use. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" and has since become a standard dataset in machine learning and statistics.

**Original Source:** Fisher, R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936)

**Current Source:** The dataset is widely available and can be found in various repositories including:
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- scikit-learn datasets
- R datasets package

## 📊 Results

### Key Findings

1. **Data Quality**: The dataset is clean with no missing values and balanced classes (50 samples per species)

2. **Feature Relationships**: 
   - Strong positive correlation between petal length and petal width (r > 0.9)
   - Moderate correlations between sepal and petal measurements

3. **Class Separability**:
   - Setosa is linearly separable from other classes
   - Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap but are distinguishable

4. **Statistical Significance**: All features show significant differences between species (ANOVA p < 0.05)

5. **Machine Learning Performance**: Multiple algorithms achieve high accuracy (>95%), with Random Forest and SVM typically performing best
